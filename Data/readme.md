When an investment firm provides portfolio details, they typically include static details (recorded at the time of investment) and dynamic details (which update periodically, often via APIs).



2. Dynamic Data (Fetched via API)
To update the current asset value, we integrate APIs such as:

Stock Market API (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud) → for real-time stock prices
Cryptocurrency API (CoinGecko, Binance API) → for live crypto prices
Gold API (Metals-API) → for live gold rates
Real Estate API (Zillow, Realtor API) → for property valuations
